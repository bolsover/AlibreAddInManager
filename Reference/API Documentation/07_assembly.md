object as the instance of the target as seen in this Occurrence.

This name should not be used as a 'key' to identifying the object, but is only intended for display purposes to help identify selected items for the user. The display name of topology objects (IADFace, etc.) may change whenever the design is changed. |
|  | Occurrence | Returns the Occurrence of this Proxy. The target retrieved from this Proxy will be in the local space of this Occurrence, where it naturally lives. |

#### Remarks

Consider an Assembly A containing a
Part P. To represent an element in P, say a
Design Plane, IADTargetProxy can be used. This
Proxy wraps the element (in this case, a Design Plane) and the Occurrence corresponding
to Component P in Assembly A. This way, the element can be represented without any ambiguity.
If the Part P is a standalone Part, then the Occurrence is null in the Proxy object.
