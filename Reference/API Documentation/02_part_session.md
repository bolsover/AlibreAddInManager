```

The IADIGESOptions type exposes the following members.

#### Properties

|  | Units | Gets/sets the units used when exporting IGES files. |

#### Remarks

After setting the desired IGES file type options, an IGES file can be
exported using these settings with the ExportIGES
method on the design session you wish to export.

#### Example

This sample shows how to change the IGES export options and export an IGES file with those options.

#### Parameters

fileName  [String](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string)
:   The full path of the file containing the surface to insert.
    Valid filetypes are \*.igs, \*.sat, and \*.3dm

faceProcessingType  ADFaceProcessingType
:   The type of face processing to be used when importing the file.

healOption  [Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.boolean)
:   If true, Alibre will attempt to heal the surface after importing.

makeTolerantOption  [Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.boolean)
:   If true, Alibre will attempt to make edges tolerant after importing.

overridingUnit  ADUnits
:   Use this parameter to override the units in the file being imported.
    The default value AD\_UNITLESS will not override the units.

#### Return Value

IObjectCollector  
Returns a collection of Surfaces that are inserted. Note
that depending upon the Face Processing Type specified, more than one surface can result
from a given file.

#### Remarks

Currently, only IGES, SAT, and 3DM files are supported.

You can specify how the faces are to be processed. Following is a description
of each of the allowed types.

- AD\_STITCH\_ADJOINING\_FACES - takes faces that meet
  at a common edge and places them in the same surface body. Each resulting lump becomes a
  surface.
- AD\_NONE - inserts the surfaces as they exist in the file. Each lump
  is a surface. The body is unchanged.
- AD\_UNSTITCH\_TO\_STANDALONE\_SURFACES - converts each face into
  a separate surface.

In addition to Face Processing type, user can also specify options for healing.

If Heal option is true, it cleans up the body by making sure edges lie on faces, eliminates
duplicate vertices, etc. Healing attempts to fix problems detected with the model by changing it.
Most IGES files require healing to import properly.

The Make Tolerant option will tag inaccurate geometry to enable more intelligent subsequent
operations after import. Because the geometry of a tolerant model is allowed to be less precise,
inaccurate or leaky data can often be imported using the Make Tolerant option. Making a model
tolerant leaves its underlying geometry unchanged.



# IADDesignMesh.Root Property

Returns the automation root.

#### Syntax

IADRoot Root { get; }

IADRoot



# IADDesignPlane.Parameters Property

Get a collection object containing IADParameter objects associated with this design geometry.

#### Syntax

#### Remarks

If a Plane is created at an offset to an existing Plane, then
Parameters include the Offset parameter specified. Similarly,
Parameters include the Angle parameter in the case of a Plane that is created at an angle to
a given Plane.

This Property returns null when called on built-in Planes (i.e. XY-Plane, YZ-Plane,
ZX-Plane).

#### Example

This Visual Basic sample shows how to get the Parameters property.

# IADIGESOptions Properties

The IADIGESOptions type exposes the following members.

#### Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | EOLLength | Gets/sets the length of the end-of-line character (in bytes). Value must be between 1 through 4. |
|  | HasBoundedSurfaces | If true, Alibre will write all surfaces as bounded when exporting IGES files. Otherwise, surfaces are written as trimmed whenever possible. |
|  | HasEllipsesAsNURBS | If true, Alibre will write ellipses as NURBs curves when exporting IGES files. This compensates for programs that do not support conic arcs. IGES uses conic arcs to write ACIS ellipses. |
|  | HasTrimmedCurves | If true, Alibre will write trimmed curves as 2D parametric curves with the trimmed curve preference for 2D data when exporting IGES files. Required when writing IGES files for CATIA. |
|  | HasTrimSurfacesAsNURBS | If true, this option specifies that all surfaces be converted to NURBs (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) and written as IGES NURBs surfaces (Entity #128). |
|  | HasWireAsCopiousData | Set this option to true to write a wire as copious data (entity #106, form 12). Otherwise, separate curves are written for the wire. |
|  | IsAutoCAD | If true, IGES files will be exported with faces specifically for use with AutoCAD. |
|  | IsJAMA | If true, the JAMA-IS v1.04 Specification, a subset of the IGES V5.0 specification, will be used to export IGES files. Setting this to true accepts the JAMA convention of not supporting some constraints. |
|  | IsMSBO | If true, parts will be exported as MSBOs (Manifold Solid B-rep Objects). Otherwise these parts are exported as trimmed faces, but without connectivity information for IGES Version 4.0 compatibility. |
|  | Units | Gets/sets the units used when exporting IGES files. |

# IADBodies Interface

This collection is needed for querying the model held by the design.
This interface represents the collection of all the bodies held by the design.
However, as per current architecture, the design holds only one solid body

#### Syntax

```
public interface IADBodies

#### Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Item | Given a numerical index into the collection, returns the corresponding body. |

#### Remarks

This collection of bodies is obtained by querying the property Bodies
on IADPartSession interface object. It is not possible to alter or delete the
body, and only query methods are supported on it.

#### Example

This Visual Basic sample demonstrates topology queries.

# IADDesignPoint.Parameters Property

Get a collection object containing IADParameter objects associated with this design geometry.

#### Syntax

```
IObjectCollector Parameters { get; }
```

#### Property Value

IObjectCollector

#### Remarks

This property will return null for the Origin Point.

Points with the following PointType properties are supported:

- AD\_POINT\_FROM\_XYZ\_COORDINATES
- AD\_POINT\_FROM\_CIRCULAR\_EDGE

For points with a PointType other than the above, this property will
throw an exception.

#### Example

This Visual Basic sample shows how to get the Parameters property.

```
Dim objAlibreSourceObjects As AlibreX.IObjectCollector
Dim objAlibreDesignPoint as AlibreX.IADDesignPoint

Set objAlibreDesignPoint = m_objAlibreDesignSession.DesignPoints ("XY-New")
Set objAlibreSourceObjects = objAlibreDesignPoint.Parameters

# IADDesignSession.ExportSTL Method

Exports the design session as an STL file.

#### Syntax

```
void ExportSTL(
	string fileName,
	double maxCellSize,
	double normalDeviation,
	double surfaceDeviation
)
```

#### Parameters

fileName  [String](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string)
:   The filepath of the exported file.

maxCellSize  [Double](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.double)
:   The maximum cell size specifies the maximum length of a side of a
    cell in object space. Since a facet cannot be larger than the cell, this determines the maximum
    size of the facet. The default is zero.

normalDeviation  [Double](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.double)
:   The normal deviation specifies the maximum angle allowed between
    two normals on a facet. The proper value is usually independent of the model size. The default
    is 10 degrees.

surfaceDeviation  [Double](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.double)
:   The surface deviation is the maximum distance between the facet
    and the true surface. The proper value is dependent on the model size. The default is zero.

#### Remarks

To use the max cell size, normal deviation, and surface deviation specified by the
user in their preferences, use the method ExportSTL2.
