  1. AD\_TO\_DEPTH - Creates an extrusion of a specified length on one side of the
     sketching plane.
  2. AD\_MID\_PLANE - Creates an extrusion of a specified length on both sides of the
     sketching plane. Half the extrusion length is proportioned to each side of the sketching plane.
  3. AD\_TO\_NEXT - Creates an extrusion to the next available face in the model in
     direction of the extrusion.
  4. AD\_TO\_GEOMETRY - Creates an extrusion up to a specified reference plane or face.
  5. AD\_THROUGH\_ALL - Creates the cut through the entire solid in the specified direction
- direction - The direction can be:
  1. AD\_ALONG\_NORMAL - Creates the extrusion normal to the sketch plane.
  2. AD\_ALONG\_AXIS - Creates the extrusion along a Design Axis.
  3. AD\_ALONG\_EDGE - Creates the extrusion along a Design Edge.
- This method will throw an exception under the following situations:
  1. If pSketch is already used by any other feature.
  2. If draftAngle falls outside the range -60 to 60.
  3. If endContion is AD\_TO\_DEPTH and depth's value is zero.
- Note that the newly created Part Feature is not added to the Collection on which this
  method is called. Query for the Collection again to get the updated Collection.
- If the created feature has an error, an error is thrown and the feature still remains
  in the features list.

# IADPartFeatures.AddSweptCutout Method

Creates a sweep cut feature, which removes material by moving a sketch along a path
defined by a second sketch.

#### Syntax

```
IADSweepFeature AddSweptCutout(
	IADSketch pProfileSketch,
	IObjectCollector pPathSketch,
	bool IsRigid,
	ADPartFeatureEndCondition endCondition,
	IADOccurrence toGeometryOcc,
	Object toGeometryObject,
	double toGeometryOffset,
	Object draftAngle,
	bool IsOutwardDraft,
	string name
)
```

#### Parameters

pProfileSketch  IADSketch
:   Denotes the sketch which will be swept along pPathSketch.

pPathSketch  IObjectCollector
:   Denotes the sketch used as a path for sweeping pProfileSketch.

IsRigid  [Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.boolean)
:   If this is set to true, pProfileSketch remains parallel to the
    profile's sketching plane throughout the sweep.

endCondition  ADPartFeatureEndCondition
:   Denotes how to terminate the sweep.

toGeometryOcc  IADOccurrence
:   Denotes an instance of toGeometryObject from an assembly.
    This can be null if toGeometryObject represents a feature obtained from a
    Part Session

toGeometryObject  [Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.object)
:   Denotes a Design Plane or a
    Face. This can be null if endCondition is not
    AD\_TO\_GEOMETRY.

toGeometryOffset  [Double](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.double)
:   Denotes the offset value to create the sweep up to a specified
    distance from the Target (toGeometryObject).

draftAngle  [Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.object)
:   This can be a number or an equation from a
    parameter. Pass zero, or a number to create a tapered sweep.

IsOutwardDraft  [Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.boolean)
:   If this is set to true, the draft will be created outwards.
    The end face of the created feature will be larger than the starting face.

name  [String](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string)
:   Name of the Part Feature created. If there is no name, a default name
    will be created for the newly created Part Feature.

#### Return Value

IADSweepFeature  
Returns the new sweep feature.

#### Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| AD\_E\_INVALID\_PATHOBJECT | The specified sweep path is not valid. |
| AD\_E\_INVALID\_ENDCONDITION | Only the AD\_TO\_GEOMETRY and AD\_ENTIRE\_PATH end conditions are valid for sweep features. |
| AD\_E\_INVALID\_GEOMETRY | toGeometryObject was not valid plane or face. |
| AD\_E\_INVALID\_ANGLE | The specified angle is not valid. |

#### Remarks

The following guidelines should be followed when creating swept features.

- The sketch that defines the profile must be closed.
- The sketch that defines the path can be open or closed but cannot be self-intersecting.
- The sketch path cannot lie on the same sketching plane as the profile.
- The sketch path must either start on the profile plane or pass through the profile plane.
- Valid values for the endCondition parameter are:
  - AD\_TO\_GEOMETRY
  - AD\_ENTIRE\_PATH
- pProfileSketch should be an unconsumed sketch.

Note that the newly created Part Feature is not added to the Collection on which this
method is called. Query for the Collection again to get the updated Collection.

If the created feature has an error, an error is thrown and the feature still remains
in the features list.

| --- | --- |
| AD\_E\_INVALID\_PATHOBJECT | The specified sweep path is not valid. |
| AD\_E\_INVALID\_ENDCONDITION | Only the AD\_TO\_GEOMETRY and AD\_ENTIRE\_PATH end conditions are valid for sweep features. |
| AD\_E\_INVALID\_GEOMETRY | toGeometryObject was not valid plane or face. |
| AD\_E\_INVALID\_ANGLE | The specified angle is not valid. |

#### Remarks

The following guidelines should be followed when creating swept features.

- The sketch that defines the profile must be closed.
- The sketch that defines the path can be open or closed but cannot be self-intersecting.
- The sketch path cannot lie on the same sketching plane as the profile.
- The sketch path must either start on the profile plane or pass through the profile plane.
- Valid values for the endCondition parameter are:
  - AD\_TO\_GEOMETRY
  - AD\_ENTIRE\_PATH
- pProfileSketch should be an unconsumed sketch.

Note that the newly created Part Feature is not added to the Collection on which this
method is called. Query for the Collection again to get the updated Collection.

If the created feature has an error, an error is thrown and the feature still remains
in the features list.

#### Example

This Visual Basic sample demonstrates adding a Sweep Boss Feature to the Part Features Collection.

    the faces specified in the parameter colMultiThickFaces. The size of this array
    should be the same as that of colMultiThickFaces, with an override thickness for
    each face in the collection. If you do not wish to override the standard thickness for
    any faces, this parameter can be null.

thicknessParameterName  [String](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string)  (Optional)
:   Name of the thickness parameter
    that will be created for the shell feature. If no name is provided, a default name will
    be generated.

    Cross sections must be either IADSketch, IADFace, or IADDesignPoint types.

Tangents  IObjectCollector
:   A collection of boolean values, to indicate whether the cross sections will
    have a specified tangency. Must either contain the same number of elements
    as CrossSections, or be null or empty to indicate that no tangency control will
    be used. If GuideCurves are specified, this parameter will be ignored.

TangentMagnitudes  IObjectCollector
:   A collection of double values, to indicate the tangent magnitude for particular
    cross sections. Must either contain the same number of elements as CrossSections,

    cross sections. Must either contain the same number of elements as CrossSections,
    or be null or empty to indicate that no tangency control will be used.
    If GuideCurves are specified, this parameter will be ignored.

GuideCurves  IObjectCollector
:   A collection of guide curves to further define the results of the loft. Guide curves
    must be of type IAD3DSketch. To indicate the loft should not use guide curves, pass
    a null or empty array.

GuideCurveType  ADLoftGuideType
:   The type of guide curves to be used with the loft feature. Will be ignored
    if no guide curves are specified.

MinimizeTwist  [Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.boolean)
:   Minimize twisting of the loft surface.

MinimizeCurvature  [Boolean](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.boolean)
