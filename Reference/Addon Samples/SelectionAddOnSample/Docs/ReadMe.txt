INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING AND INSTALLING SelectionSample AddOn
===============================================================

1. Open SampleAddOn.sln in Microsoft Visual Studio (this sample was last built with Visual Studio 2022 and tested on Alibre Desing V29)

2. Open the include file StdAfx.H. Change the line that reads #import "C:Program Files\Alibre Design\Program\AlibreX_64.tlb" to point to the correct file path of AlibreX_64.tlb on your computer. This is usually C:Program Files\Alibre Design\Program unless you installed Alibre Design in a different location.

Similarly, modify the line that reads #include  "C:\Program Files\Alibre Design\Program\AlibreAddOn_64.tlb" raw_interfaces_only.

3. Save changes by clicking the File->Save menu command.

4. Next, make sure the Active Solution Configuration is "Release" and the Active Solution Platform is "x64". Click "Build->Rebuild Solution" command to build the sample Addon. This will create the DLL SampleAddon.DLL under "Release" folder. This DLL is meant to be loaded in Alibre's Add-on environment.

5. We are now ready to install the built add-on in its final delivery location:

	a. In Windows Explorer, navigate to your "ProgramData" folder (%PROGRAMDATA%). There, create a subfolder named "Alibre AddOns" if it does not already exist. Finally, below this sub folder, create a new sub folder named say, "SelectionSample".

	b. Next copy the following files from the addon's project folder to the new folder (i.e., %PROGRAMDATA%\Alibre AddOns\SelectionSample) that you just created:
	
	i)  SampleAddOnForTesting.adc
	ii) TestSampleAddOn.ico
	iii)SampleAddOn.dll

Note that we built SampleAddOn.dll in step 4.

6. Review the SampleAddOnForTesting.adc file from the above step using a text editor like NotePad. This adc file has been pre-created for this sample. Note that each add-on needs a GUID to uniquely identify it. Close the file without making any changes.


7. Using a Windows registry viewer like RegEdit.EXE :

	- Navigate to the following registry key:
	  "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Alibre Design Add-Ons"

	- Add a new String Value under this key.

	- Set the Value Name to the guid that is unique to this addon:
	  {3B769D4E-5222-4066-9608-8B4CF93671DD}
	  Note: This should match entry in SampleAddOnForTesting.adc file.

	- Set the Value Data to the addon's installation folder. In this expample, this would be:
	  C:\ProgramData\Alibre AddOns\SelectionSample

	- Close Registry

8. To run this add-on:

	- Launch Alibre Design

	- Open the assembly file, ".\Data\A1.AD_ASM", that is delivered with this add-on project. (Or, you can also open Part file, "P1.AD_PRT")

	- Click the "Add-on" tab on Alibre Design's ribbon. You should see the "Selection Sample AddOn" show up as a drop down menu on the ribbon

	- From the "Selection Sample AddOn" drop down menu, click "Activate UI" menu command. You should see a "Selection Sample AddOn" tab page shown on AD's Explorer pane.

	- Next, from the "Selection Sample AddOn" drop down menu, click "Select Object" command. This will populate the tab page created above with various radio buttons.
	  Click a radio button, say, "Select First Face". Notice that a face gets selected on the graphics window. Try other radio buttons.
	  
	  Place a break point at the method OnSelect() in the file CSelectObjectCommand.CPP perform above steps after launching AD inside the debugger to step through 
	  the add-on's code. Study the implementation there to see how the various entities are selected using AlibreX api.
